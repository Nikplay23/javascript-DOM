# DOM Atomic 02: Hide Many Elements

## Questions

---

> How did you go about selecting the DOM elements to hide? Describe the "contract" for that function.

Lai to izdarītu es izmantoju get.ElementsByClassName un tur norādiju noteikto klasi. Tādēļ es izveidoju elementu paslēpšanu.

---

> Describe how you were able to hide each element. Were you able to do it as one operation, or did you use a loop of some kind? Describe the "contracts" that were utilized to accomplish your goal.

Es izmantoju Loop, lai pārvietotos pa savāktajiem elementiem. Arī bija jānorāda cikla lielumu un ko pildīs katra klase
